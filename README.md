# 360 Interview Task
I have implemented TestNG Testcases for testing functionality of TelephoneDialPad in Task code. 

Please find the link for the 360Assignment.zip file which contains code and the attached TestCasesForTelephoneDailPad.xlsx file for manual test cases.

Steps to run the Tests:

1. Please import the project as a Maven project.
2. TestTelephoneDialPad contains Testcases.3. For running the test suite, RHM click on testng.xml and run as TestNG suite.

# Master Thesis 

# Objective:
The main objective of this thesis is to develop an ML approach to recognize objects in a fused image (fused image is comprised of thermal image and camera image). In order to fulfil this objective, various image fusion techniques are explored and implemented to generate a fused image dataset. Based on comparison results, the best image fusion technique is used to develop the most accurate ML model for detecting objects from an input image.
Research Questions:
1.	Which image fusion technique is most suitable for fusing thermal and camera image?
2.	How efficiently these image fusion techniques can be used to develop a new fused image dataset?
3.	Which ML approach gives the best accuracy in detecting objects from a fused image in the real world?
4.	How to increase the accuracy and efficiency of chosen fusion method further? Which other image processing or ML algorithms need to be used to enhance selected approach?
This research performs enormous experiments to explore these research questions and, in the end, concludes the best solution.

# Implementation

1. Data Collection using Web Scraping
2. Developed CNN model and used concatenation for fusion of images
3. Compared performance of this approch with tradition fusion methods
4. Improved Accuracy of CNN models using Data Augmentation
5. Used DenseNet121 to improve accuracy of the model
6. Using Best Machine Learning model from my experiments in real world application
